Steps for Running the code

We have train and test data in Trainbatch.txt and Testbatch.txt.
We use a CRF++ to train our model.

Also provided are 3 template files for training the model:
a. Using Only POS Tags
b. Using POS Tags and Stylistic Features
c. Using POS Tags and Stylsitic Features( Double weightage to POS Tags)

To train a model:
 
	crf_learn <template_file_name> TrainBatch.txt <tagger_model_name>

To test a model:
	
	crf_test -m <tagger_model_name> TestBatch.txt -> <outputfilename.txt>

To check Accuracy of model:

	python accuracy.py <outputfilename.txt>
